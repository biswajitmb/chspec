# chspec: Local models in XSPEC for X-ray spectra from Astrophysical plasma with CHIANTI database

The chspec package includes multiple models for calculating photon spectrum for different temperature distributions that can be loaded in [XSPEC](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xanadu/xspec/) spectral fitting package. At present it includes two models
* chisoth   : Emission from isothermal plasm
* chgausdem : Emission from Gaussian distribution of Differential Emission Measure

These  models  calculate  the synthetic photon spectrum from a spectral library, generated by using the atomic database package [CHIANTI](https://www.chiantidatabase.org/). The pre-caulated spectra over grid of temperatures is stored in a FITS file.

The isothermal model takes logarithm of the temperature (LogT), abundances (Ax) of the elements with Z=2 to Z=30, and the volume emission measure as input parameters. The volume emissionmeasure is implemented as a normalization factor, which is in the units of 10e46/cm3. For the gaussian DEM model, peak temperature and width of Gaussian (in log) are input parameters in addition to the abundances. Normalization gives peak emission measure in units of 10e46/cm3. 

Details of chisoth model is given in the appendix of [Mondal, Biswajit et al. 2021, ApJ.](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ac14c1)

## Pre-requisites

[HEASOFT](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/heasoft/) package along with the [XSPEC](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xanadu/xspec/) is required for the installation of chspec package.

## Installation

Download the chspec package an unzip and place the chspec directory in desired location. Go to the chspec directory
After downloading it, go to the CHISOTH directory:

```
cd chspec
```
If you have not executed the init script for heasoft in your environment, it needs to be done, usually by executing `heainit' if that alias is set.

To install chspec package, run the install.sh script:

```
./install.sh
```

This will download  fits table file and keep under chspec/tables using wget. If you require proxy setting for download, edit the first line in the install.sh script. Then, the model will be compiled and installed  

## Usage

Open XSPEC command prompt and run the following

```
xspec > lmod chspec /path to/chspec/
```
You can also include this in your .xspec/xspec.rc file to load the model on XSPEC startup automatically. 

Now the `chisoth' and `chgausdem' models will be available for use as as an [XSPEC model](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xanadu/xspec/manual/node27.html). They may be defined like:

```
xspec > model chisoth
xspec > model chgausdem 
```
